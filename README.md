# 🌟 Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

This repository provides an overview of the resources and instructions to help you get started with Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor that makes writing stylesheets more efficient and maintainable. You can watch the entire playlist here: [Net-Ninja - Sass Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jxJX7vojNVK-o8ubDZEcNb)

## 🎉 [Introduction](./01_Introduction/README.md)

- SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic language. 💪
- It allows you to use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, and mixins, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. 🌐

## ⚙️ [Compiling SASS](./02_Compiling_SASS/README.md)

- To use SASS, you need to compile your `.scss` files into standard CSS. 🖥️
- There are several tools available to do this, including command-line tools, build systems, and task runners like Gulp and Grunt, as well as bundlers like Webpack. 🚀

## 🔧 [Variables](./03_Variables/README.md)

- SASS variables allow you to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. 🔄
- Variables are defined with a `$` symbol followed by the variable name and value. 💼

## 📁 [Partials &amp; @import](./04_Partials_@import/README.md)

- Partials are SASS files that you can import into other SASS files using the `@import` directive. 📎
- Partials start with an underscore, which lets SASS know not to compile them directly. 🗂️

## 🏗️ [Project Structure](./05_Project_Structure/README.md)

- A well-structured SASS project helps in managing and maintaining the code efficiently. 🏢
- Common practices include organizing styles into base, components, layout, pages, themes, and utilities folders. 🗃️

## 📝 [Nested Rules](./06_Nested_Rules/README.md)

- SASS allows you to nest CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. 📐
- This makes your code more readable and maintainable. 📖

## ➕ [Using Math](./07_Using_Math/README.md)

- SASS has built-in math operators which you can use to perform calculations. 🧮
- This is particularly useful for responsive design and grid systems. 📏

## 🗺️ [Maps](./08_Maps/README.md)

- SASS maps are a way to store related data, much like dictionaries or hashes in other programming languages. 📊
- They are defined using the `()` syntax and can be accessed and manipulated with built-in functions. 🔍

## 🔄 [Loops](./09_Loops/README.md)

- Loops in SASS, such as `@for`, `@each`, and `@while`, allow you to iterate over lists, maps, or generate repeated styles efficiently. 🔂

## 🤔 [Conditionals (@if)](./10_Conditionals_@if/README.md)

- SASS conditionals use the `@if` directive to apply styles based on conditions. ⚖️
- This makes it possible to add logic to your stylesheets. 💡

## 🔄 [Parent Selectors](./11_Parent_Selectors/README.md)

- The `&` symbol in SASS refers to the parent selector, which allows you to create more complex selectors and avoid repetition in your styles. 🔁

## 🔄 [Mixins](./12_Mixins/README.md)

- Mixins are reusable chunks of code that can be included in other selectors. ♻️
- They are defined using the `@mixin` directive and included with `@include`. 📦

## 🧮 [Functions](./13_Functions/README.md)

- SASS functions are similar to mixins but they return values. 🔙
- They are defined using the `@function` directive and can be used to create complex calculations and return dynamic values. 🧑‍🔬

## ⚒️ [Making Utility Classes](./14_Making_Utility_Classes/README.md)

- Utility classes are single-purpose classes that can be reused across your project. 🛠️
- SASS makes it easy to generate these classes programmatically. 📐

## 📱 [Media Queries](./15_Media_Queries/README.md)

- SASS can simplify the use of media queries with features like variables and nesting, making it easier to write and maintain responsive styles. 📱

## 📏 [Making a Grid System](./16_Making_a_Grid_System/part1.md)

- SASS can be used to create custom grid systems by leveraging its variables, functions, and mixins. 🧩
- This allows for more flexible and maintainable grid layouts. 📏

## ➕ [Using @extend](./17_Using_@extend/README.md)

- The `@extend` directive in SASS allows one selector to inherit the styles of another. 🧬
- This helps in reducing code duplication and creating a more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) stylesheet. 📝

## 📚 [Using the CSS Library](./18_Using_the_CSS_Library/README.md)

- SASS can be integrated with existing CSS libraries, allowing you to extend their functionality with custom styles and components. 📚

## 🧹 [Purging CSS](./19_Purging_CSS/README.md)

- Purging CSS involves removing unused CSS rules to reduce the file size of your stylesheets. 🗑️
- This can be done using tools that analyze your HTML and remove any unused selectors. 🧼

## 🎨 [Customizing the Library](./20_Customizing_the_Library/README.md)

- Customizing an existing CSS library with SASS allows you to override default styles and add your own unique look and feel to your project. 🎨

## 📈 [Extending the Library Yourself](./21_Extending_the_Library_Yourself/README.md)

- Extending a CSS library involves adding new styles and components that complement and build upon the existing library, leveraging the power of SASS to create a cohesive design system. 🌟
